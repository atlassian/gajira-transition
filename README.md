![Issue Transition](../assets/example.gif?raw=true)

Example transition action:

```yaml
- name: Transition issue
  id: transition
  uses: atlassian/gajira-transition@v3
  with:
    issue: GA-181

```

The `issue` parameter can be an issue id created or retrieved by an upstream action – for example, [`Create`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-create) or [`Find Issue Key`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-find). Here is full example workflow:

```yaml

  push
